# Version Control #

Version control (also known as revision or source control) is a shared repository for all artifacts needed to build the project from scratch, including source code build scripts, and storage for automated tests as they are generated. Version control maintains the latest source code so developers are all working on build systems with the most up-to-date code.

Version control is the first prerequisite, or zero practice, described because it is the foundation for a practical development environment, and it should be implemented before going any further.

* Select an appropriate version control system. Git is the most popular open-source tool available today.
* Put everything needed to build the product from scratch into the version control system so that critical knowledge isn't held only by specific individuals.
* Whether centralized or distributed, team members can check code out of the version control before adding, modifying, and removing elements and before checking it back in. Updates can also be made to download any changes made by the team since the last check out.
