## Static Code Analysis ##

Static code analysis is a way to analyze code without executing it (in opposite to dynamic code analysis). Most of the time code is parsed into an intermediate code representation that can more easily be checked.

Static Code Analysis finds a wide range of issues: code style, code best practices, security, complexity, compatibility etc.
